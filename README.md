# Employee Directory

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. An employee can search for a collegue by name and filter them by name, titlel email and location.
